This is a **React-based frontend** for an interactive planetary map classifier. Users can explore the surfaces of **Mars, Moon, and Vesta**, select areas of interest, and send them for terrain analysis via a backend neural network.  

The frontend enables:

- Viewing high-resolution planetary basemaps from NASA.
- Selecting regions on the map for analysis using right-click and drag.
- Capturing selected areas to clipboard or sending them for classification.
- Uploading images manually or pasting them directly into the interface.
- Receiving immediate feedback about terrain type and model confidence.
